Simple practice using classes and objects in Java.

Car.java is a class containing car objects (make, color, MPG) with setters and getters and functions to display information about the car object. CarTest.java implements the Car.java class to show its functionality, making several cars with different constructor methods and sending the information to carInfo.txt .
